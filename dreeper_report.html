		<h1>A detailed report on the Dreeper Origin</h1>
			<p>TLDR; I can&#39;t accept this Origin into the server yet. Read below for reasons.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><code>pack.mcmeta</code> is incomplete. A description is not provided.
				<ul>
					<li>Line 4: <code>&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Your Description Here!&quot;</code> It is highly recommended to add a description to datapacks, despite them not normally showing up in a server menu.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Some abilities have issues, whether those be technical or other reasons.
				<ul>
					<li>3 abilities do not have a clear reason for their presence (<code>origins:slow_falling</code>, <code>drep:speedy</code>, <code>drep:small_boy</code>)</li>
					<li>3 abilities have technical issues
						<ul>
							<li>1 is hidden from the ability list (<code>drep:lush_colour</code>)</li>
							<li>1 has a file typo (<code>origin:no_shield</code>)</li>
							<li>1 has multiplier issues (<code>drep:explosive</code>)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>No malcious code was found within the datapack.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Abilities</h2>
		<h4>You can click on a file location to jump to that file&#39;s GitHub page. Genesis does not have a GitHub page.</h4>
		<h4>+ Flight (Permanent Elytra) <code>drep:flight</code> Source: Unknown</h4>
			<p>This ability is fine how it is.</p>
		<h4>+ Flap your wings (Flight Launch) <code>drep:launch</code> Source: Genesis (<code>\data\genesis\powers\dragonkin\launch.json</code>)</h4>
			<p>This ability is fine how it is.</p>
		<h4>+ One of Us (Creeper Immunity) <code>drep:creeper_tolerance</code> Source: Unknown</h4>
			<p>This ability is fine how it is.</p>
		<h4>####+ Small Explosion <code>drep:mini_explosion</code> Source: Unknown<h4></h4> 
			<p>This ability is fine how it is.</p>
		<h4>+ Featherweight <code>origins:slow_falling</code> Source: Origins <a href="https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/blob/1.17/src/main/resources/data/origins/powers/slow_falling.json" title="(`/src/main/resources/data/origins/powers/slow_falling.json`)">(<code>/src/main/resources/data/origins/powers/slow_falling.json</code>)</a></h4>
			<p>This ability is coded fine, but <strong>I do not know the reason for slow falling.</strong></p>
		<h4>+ Speedy (Permanent Speed I) <code>drep:speedy</code> Source: Original</h4>
			<p>This ability is coded fine, <strong>but I do not know the reason for permanent speed.</strong></p>
		<h4>= Small Boi (Reduced Height) <code>drep:small_boy</code> Source: Octo, but I do not care</h4>
			<p>This ability is coded fine, though <strong>I do not know the reason for the height being reduced.</strong> Creepers are about the same height as a player model.</p>
		<h4>= null (Ambient Gunpowder Particles) <code>drep:gunpowder_particles</code> Source: Original?</h4>
			<p>This ability is fine how it is.</p>
		<h4>= Suck it Green Boi (Skin Color Change) <code>drep:lush_colour</code> Source: Original?</h4>
			<p>Within this file, the <code>&quot;hidden&quot;</code> value is set to <code>true</code>. Despite this having a name and description, the <code>&quot;hidden&quot;</code> value hides it from the Origin ability list in-game. It is recommended that you set this to <code>false</code>, or remove line 3 entirely. I must note that if you want the exact colors from our current Creeper origin, you need 0.7 red instead of 0.6 red.</p>
		<h4>- Deathly Allergic (Damage Near Cats) <code>drep:deathly_allergy</code>  Source: OriginsPlus <a href="https://github.com/lochnessdragon/OriginsPlus/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/originsplus/powers/scared_of_cats.json" title="(`/src/main/resources/data/originsplus/powers/scared_of_cats.json`)">(<code>/src/main/resources/data/originsplus/powers/scared_of_cats.json</code>)</a></h4>
			<p>This ability is fine how it is. I would recommend changing the description to say how much damage is dealt in each interval, though it is not necessary to getting the Origin accepted.</p>
		<h4>- Explosive (Fire Vulnerability) <code>drep:explosive</code> Source: OriginsPlus <a href="https://github.com/lochnessdragon/OriginsPlus/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/originsplus/powers/flammable.json" title="(`/src/main/resources/data/originsplus/powers/flammable.json`)">(<code>/src/main/resources/data/originsplus/powers/flammable.json</code>)</a></h4>
			<p>The &quot;Explosive&quot; ability causes the player to take more damage while in fire. Despite this being the intended purpose, <em>the value by which the damage is multiplied is set to 1. </em>This means that there is no damage being multiplied, making the drawback ineffective. You must set this to a higher value in order to get your origin approved.</p>
		<h4>- Unwieldy (Shield Inability) <code>origin:no_shield</code> Source: Origins <a href="https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/blob/1.17/src/main/resources/data/origins/powers/no_shield.json" title="(`/src/main/resources/data/origins/powers/no_shield.json`)">(<code>/src/main/resources/data/origins/powers/no_shield.json</code>)</a></h4>
			<p>The file reference for this ability is not valid. The correct file would be <code>origins:no_shield</code>.</p>
